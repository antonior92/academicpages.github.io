I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm interested in training models of dynamic systems from observed data and on the development of new methods to cope with this kind of problem.

I've published results about system identification problems such as: Â [the comparison between different training methods for neural networks dynamic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07119v1), [the estimation of output error models using multiple shooting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317332469) and [the development of methods for choosing data windows to train empirical models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315008915). The latter was my contribution to a R&D project with [Petrobras Oil Company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/).

On the industry side I've worked as hardware developer intern at [Invent Vision](http://www.ivision.ind.br), a startup that produces industrial cameras. There I developed a prototype of a FPGA-based stereo camera. 

I've contributed to large open-source projects, specifically to the optimization and signal processing packages of the Python scientific library [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html). My contributions include the implementation of IIR filters (functions [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch) and [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak)), trust-region methods (method [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html)) and  improvements on some already implemented methods (such as the [``BFGS``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-bfgs.html) implementation). 

During the last few months I have worked on my [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project: a large-scale optimization algorithm to be integrated to Scipy. The implementation is available in [this](https://github.com/antonior92/ip-nonlinear-solver) github repository and is being integrated to SciPy through the pull request [\#7729](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7729).

I'm comfortable working with C/C++, Python, Matlab, Julia and R and I have skills on optimization, machine learning, system identification and control.
