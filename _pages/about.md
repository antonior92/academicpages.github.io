I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm interested in training models of dynamic systems from observed data and I am working on non-convex formulations of this problem.

I've worked on a variety of system identification problems, such as: Â [the comparison between different training methods for neural networks dynamic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07119v1), [the aplication of the multiple shooting technique to output error models](https://antonior92.github.io/files/2017-IFAC.pdf) and [the develop of methods for choosing data windows to train empirical models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315008915). The latter problem was my contribution to a research and development project with [Petrobras oil company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/).

I've some contributions to large open-source projects, specifically I have contributed optimization and signal processing packages of the python scientific library [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) with contributions such as IIR filters implementations (functions [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch) and [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak)) and trust-region methods (method [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html)). I've also made improvements on some already implemented methods (such as the [``BFGS``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-bfgs.html) implementation). 

During the last few months I have been working on a large-scale optimization algorithm to be integrated to Scipy as part of my [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project, which is described on a series of blog posts that can be found [here](https://antonior92.github.io/tags/#gsoc-2017).

On the industry side I have worked during a year on [Invent Vision](http://www.ivision.ind.br), a startup that produces Industrial Cameras. There I have helped on the development of a FPGA-based stereo camera.

I'm confortable working with C/C++, Python, Matlab, Julia and R, among other programming laguages and I have skills on optimization, machine learning, system identification and control.
