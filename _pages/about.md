I am a Brazilian electrical engineer currently working towards my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en). I am interested in training models of dynamic systems from observed data and I am working on non-convex formulations of this problem.

I have worked on a variety of system identification problems, such as  [the comparison between different training methods for neural networks dynamic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07119v1), [the adaptation of the multiple shooting technique to the context of system identification](https://antonior92.github.io/files/2017-IFAC.pdf), [the study of the static curve of Hammerstein models](http://www.swge.inf.br/CBA2014/anais/PDF/1569890815.pdf) and [the develop of methods for choosing data windows to train empirical models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315008915). The latter problem was my contribution to a research and development project with [Petrobras oil company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/).

I have some contributions to open source projects. Specifically I have contribuuted to [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) optimization and signal processing packages: I have implemented IIR filters  (functions [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch) and [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak)), trust-region methods (optimization method [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html)) and made improvements on other optimization methods such as the [BFGS]((http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-bfgs.html)) implementation. And, during the last few mounths, I have been working on a large-scale optimization algorithm to be integrated to [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) as part of my [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project. I have been describing the project progress on a series of [blog posts](https://antonior92.github.io/tags/#gsoc-2017).
