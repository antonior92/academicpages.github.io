I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interest lay in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and control theory. I'm interested in training models of dynamic systems from observed data and on the development of new methods to cope with this kind of problem.

I've studied problems such as: [the comparison between different training methods for neural networks dynamic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07119), [the estimation of output error models using multiple shooting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317332469) and [the development of methods for choosing data windows to train empirical models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315008915). The latter was my contribution to a R&D project with [Petrobras Oil Company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/).

I've contributed to large open-source projects, more specifically to the optimization and signal processing packages of the Python scientific library [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html). I am a member of Scipy core development team and my contributions include the implementation of IIR filters (functions [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch) and [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak)), trust-region optimization methods (method [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html)) and other general improvements (such as improvements in the [``BFGS``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-bfgs.html) implementation). 

On the industry side I've worked as hardware developer intern at [Invent Vision](http://www.ivision.ind.br), a startup that produces industrial cameras. There I developed the prototype of a FPGA-based stereo camera. I have also participated on [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program. My project was the development of an interior-point method solver for large-scale nonlinear programming problems. The implementation is available in the github repository [https://github.com/antonior92/ip-nonlinear-solver](https://github.com/antonior92/ip-nonlinear-solver) and is being integrated to SciPy through the pull request [\#7729](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7729).

Iâ€™m comfortable working with C/C++, Python, Matlab, Julia and R and I have skills on optimization, machine learning, system identification and signal processing.
