My initial plan for this blog post was to present the results of applying the
interior point method on large problems from CUTEst library. Unfortunatelly
these results are not ready yet. So instead I will provide an example
of the solver on a very simple example.

Consider the following minimization problem: \[1\]
\begin{eqnarray}
  \min_x && \frac{1}{2}(x -2)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(y - \frac{1}{2})^2, \\\\\\
   \text{subject to } && (x + 1)^{-1} - y - \frac{1}{4} \ge 0,\\\\\\
&& x \ge 0, \\\\\\
&& y \ge 0, \\\\\\
\end{eqnarray}

The following figure taken from \[1\] ilustrate this optimization problem:

The code for solving this problem using the implemented solver is presented next:
