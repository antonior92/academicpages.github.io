This year I was chosen as the student for Google Summer of Code.
Iâ€™ll be working on one of the core Python scientific libraries called scipy.
My task is to implement a constrained optimization algorithm able to deal with
large (and possibly sparse) problems for which the constrained optimization
methods currently implemented in Scipy (namely `SLSQP` and `COBYLA`) are
largely inappropriate to deal with.

My full proposal can be found in the following ![link](https://github.com/antonior92/GSoC2017-Scipy).
