This year I was chosen as the student for Google Summer of Code.
Iâ€™ll be working on one of the core Python scientific libraries called scipy.
My task is to implement a constrained optimization algorithm able to deal with
large (and possibly sparse) problems.

The optimization problem consists of finding the value
of a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ that minimizes a function $f(x)$
inside a region $\Omega$. It is very common to specify 
$\Omega$ using equality and inequality constraints,
as expressed in the following mathematical expresion:

\begin{equation}
   \min_{x}  f(x)~\text{subject to } c_E(x) = 0,~c_I(x) \ge 0,
\end{equation}

where $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of unknowns and $f$ is called the objective
function and $c_E$ and $c_I$ are vectorial functions used to delimit the feasible region
$\Omega$.

Great many applications can be formulated as the above optimization problem: $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$
could be the control action applied to a robot arm in order to follow a given trajectory,
being the function $f(x)$ minimized in order to get the optimal control action
while avoiding colliding wih obstacles (represented by the constaints); alternatively,
the problem could represent the designing of a portfolio of investments to maximize expected 
return while maintaining an acceptable level of risk; or, the estimation of parameters of 
a model, minimizing the error between the model prediction and the observed values, while
imposing a series of constraints to the model. 

It suffice to say that optimization is very important to several applications 
in engieneering, science and finance and I believe that a quality open source
solver, as the one I intend to implement, could be of great use to people from
diverse areas.
