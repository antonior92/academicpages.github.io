title: "Shooting Methods for Parameter Estimation of Output Error Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-IFAC
excerpt: 'This paper studies parameter estimation of output error (OE) models. The
commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error is called single shooting in
contrast with the new multiple shooting approach proposed in this paper, for which the free-run
simulation error of sub-datasets is minimized subject to equality constraints. The names “single
shooting” and “multiple shooting” are used due to the similarities with techniques for estimating
ODE (ordinary differential equation) parameters. Examples with nonlinear polynomial models
illustrate the advantages of OE models as well as the capability of the multiple shooting approach
to avoid undesirable local minima.'
