title: "Selecting Transients Automatically for the Identification of Models for an Oil Well"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-IFAC
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a procedure to automatically select transient windows for system identification from routine operation data. To this end two metrics are proposed. One quantifies the transient content in a given window and the other provides an overall measure of correlation between such transients and the chosen model input. The procedure is illustrated using data from an oil well that operates in deep waters.'

**Abstract: This paper proposes a procedure to automatically select transient windows for system identification from routine operation data. To this end two metrics are proposed. One quantifies the transient content in a given window and the other provides an overall measure of correlation between such transients and the chosen model input.
